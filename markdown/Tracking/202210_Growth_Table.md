## Data

### Height/Stature Measurements (WHO Standards)

| Age | Height (cm) | Percentile |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| 1 year 11 months | 88 | 56% |
| 2 years 9 months | 93 | 33% |
| 2 years 11 months | 96 | 51% |
| 3 years 2 months | 96 | 30% |
| 3 years 10 months | 100 | 30% |

## Key Metrics

- **Final Height**: 100 cm (at 3 years 10 months)
- **Height Gain**: 12 cm over ~2 years
- **Average Percentile**: ~40%
- **Percentile Range**: 30% - 56%

## Observations

- Height started above median (56th percentile) at 1 year 11 months
- Percentile dropped to 33% by 2 years 9 months
- Brief recovery to 51% at 2 years 11 months
- Stabilized at 30th percentile from 3 years 2 months onward
- Growth velocity appears normal despite percentile changes

## Trends

- Overall downward trend in height percentile from 56% to 30%
- Percentile variability suggests possible measurement timing or growth spurts
- Current trajectory stable at 30th percentile
- Growth following WHO standards for male children

## Notes

- Data from mobile growth tracking app (likely "Tabelas" app)
- Based on WHO (OMS) growth standards for boys
- Percentile changes may reflect normal growth variation
- No concerning deviations from expected growth patterns

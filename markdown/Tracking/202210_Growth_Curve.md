# Tracking Document

**Date**: October 2022
**Document Type**: Growth Curve
**Patient**: Isaac

## Overview

- **Tracking Category**: Growth
- **Period**: 20 - 50 months of age
- **Source**: WHO Growth Curve (OMS Curva de Estatura para Isaac)

## Data

### Growth Curve Visualization

The growth curve chart shows Isaac's height plotted against WHO percentile bands:

| Percentile Lines | Color |
|------------------|-------|
| 3% / 97% | Red (outer) |
| 5% / 95% | Red |
| 10% / 90% | Orange |
| 25% / 75% | Green |
| 50% | Green (median) |

### Plotted Data Points

| Age (months) | Height (cm) | Position on Chart |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| ~23 months | 88 | Between 25-50th percentile |
| ~33 months | 93 | Between 25-50th percentile |
| ~35 months | 96 | Near 25-50th percentile |
| ~38 months | 96 | Near 25th percentile |
| ~46 months | 100 | Near 25th percentile |

## Key Metrics

- **Chart Type**: WHO Height-for-age curve
- **Age Range Displayed**: 20-55 months
- **Height Range Displayed**: 70-130 cm
- **Growth Trajectory**: Following curve between 25th and 50th percentiles

## Observations

- Growth curve follows expected trajectory for healthy child
- Data points remain within normal range (above 25th percentile)
- No significant deviations from expected growth pattern
- Curve shows consistent upward trend as expected with age
- Slight flattening visible around 35-38 months

## Trends

- Started tracking around 50th percentile at ~23 months
- Gradual drift toward 25th percentile over time
- Parallel tracking to standard growth curves
- Growth velocity appears appropriate despite percentile change
- Recent measurements stable at ~30th percentile

## Notes

- Mobile app visualization (likely "Curvas" app on Android)
- WHO growth standards are international reference
- Percentile position less important than following the curve
- Minor percentile changes are normal and expected
- Growth appears healthy and consistent

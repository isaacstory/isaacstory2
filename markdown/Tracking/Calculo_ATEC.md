## Key Metrics

- **Assessment Tool**: ATEC (Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist)
- **Total Items**: 77 items across 4 categories
- **Assessment Intervals**: ~3-6 months apart
- **Scoring**: Lower scores indicate improvement

## Observations

### October 2021 (Baseline)
- Significant language delays (most items "Not true")
- Social challenges present (eye contact, attention, interaction)
- Toileting issues (serious problem with wetting/soiling)
- Some repetitive movements noted

### February 2022 (3 months later)
- Slight improvement in single word use
- Better attention when spoken to
- Improved eye contact
- Toileting improved (minor problem vs serious)
- New behavioral concerns: hurts others, destructive, screaming

### July 2022 (6 months later)
- Continued language gains (follows commands better)
- Facial expressions improved
- Toileting maintained improvement
- Repetitive movements improved significantly
- Obsession with objects/topics worsened (serious problem)

## Trends

- **Language**: Gradual improvement in receptive language and single word use
- **Sociability**: Mixed - some improvements in eye contact, new challenges with affection
- **Cognition**: Stable with slight gains in awareness and imagination
- **Health/Behavior**: Toileting significantly improved; obsessive interests increased

## Notes

- ATEC is a parent-reported assessment tool commonly used in autism treatment monitoring
- Lower total scores indicate fewer autistic symptoms
- Assessment shows typical uneven development pattern seen in ASD
- Treatment appears to be helping with some areas while others remain challenging

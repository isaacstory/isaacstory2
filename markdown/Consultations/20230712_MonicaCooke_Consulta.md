## Plan

### Awaiting Results
- MitoSwab test results
- FRAT (Folate Receptor Antibody Test) results

### Follow-up
- Borderline tongue tie assessment

### Diet
- Continue Gluten/Soy/Milk free diet with little corn and no sugar

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **MED13 Genetic Testing** - Have mom and dad tested for MED13 variant
   - Questions for geneticist:
     - How conserved is this location? How important is this to gene function?
     - What kind of mutation is it? Frame shift/Deletion/Missense?

2. **Stool Test** - Repeat GPL CSAP at least one week after completing GUT protocol

3. **Medication List** - Send current medication list via portal message with dosage and frequency

### Treatment Steps

*Start each intervention with 5 days in between to judge response*

1. **Probiotics**
   - Continue Culturelle for 2 weeks post GUT protocol
   - Can stop Saccharomyces boulardii

2. **Sleep Support**
   - Increase NAC to two capsules at bedtime (may also help with GUT protocol symptoms)
   - If NAC doesn't help, may increase Day Chill to up to 1 capsule if needed

3. **Biotin** - Add Biotin 10mg (10,000mcg) daily
   - Gummies OK, any brand OK
   - Purpose: Help with fatty acid processing (based on OAT results)

4. **Lutimax Pediatric Powder** - 1/4 tsp two times a day
   - Purpose: Anti-inflammatory support; help with high lysozyme levels

5. **Butyrate Sodium** - 1 capsule daily
   - Purpose: Energy for focus; promote growth of good gut flora

6. **BodyBio PC (Choline supplement)** - 1/8 tsp two times a day, not after 4pm
   - Purpose: Basic support
   - Note: Ensure B12 & Folate are on board while on Choline

### GUT Protocol Phase 2 (Completed/Ongoing)

- A) Augmentin 2.5ml twice a day for 14 days
- B) Red root, 10 drops three times a day, for 14 days
- C) Clove, 10 drops three times a day, for 14 days
- D) Juniper, 10 drops three times a day, for 14 days

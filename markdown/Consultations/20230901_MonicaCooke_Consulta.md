## Plan

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Ear/Sinus Evaluation**: Have Isaac's PCP evaluate ears/sinuses due to ear holding and new behaviors since travel and return to Brazil - determine if there is pain source causing symptoms
2. **Pending**: Stool test result with GPL CSAP
3. **Pending**: Labs

### Treatment Steps

*Start each intervention with 5 days in between to judge response. Supplement prescriptions via FullScript with discounts.*

1. **Medication Review**:
   - Give B12 1 drop if that is all he will tolerate
   - May stop Butyrate or try giving in cooked foods
   - For irritability: DHH-B 1/2 capsule during day; decrease to 1/4 if too sleepy (or less); increase if needed to calm Isaac and reduce irritability

2. **Add ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid)**: 100mg in the morning to help decrease oxidative stress

3. **Add Ubiquinol**: 100mg in the morning to help with complex-II+III activity
   - Most effective as softgel (squeeze liquid out) OR liquid form (2 tsp = 100mg in AM)

### Diet

Continue Gluten/Soy/Milk free diet with little corn, and no sugar

### Follow-Up

- Borderline tongue tie assessment to be followed
- Fill out Upcoming Visit Form 7-10 days before next visit
- Check-in and update information at least 7 days before next visit

## Test Results

| Test | Outcome | Measured Result | Units | Status |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Blocking | NEGATIVE | Not Detectable | pmol blocked per ml | Normal |
| Binding | NEGATIVE | Not Detectable | OD Units | Normal |

## Assay Notes

- Folate receptor (FR) blocking antibody is defined as an antibody that blocks the binding of folic acid to the folate receptor.
- The concentration of antibodies is known to fluctuate over time (and in response to changes in cow's milk intake) so repeating the test, if clinically warranted, has been recommended.

## Interpretation

Both folate receptor antibody tests (blocking and binding) returned **NEGATIVE** results with no detectable antibodies. This suggests no current interference with folate transport via the folate receptor pathway.

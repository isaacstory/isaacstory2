## Test Description

Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (RC-I, RC-II, RC-II+III, and RC-IV) activities and Citrate Synthase (CS) enzyme activity measured in buccal cells to evaluate mitochondrial function.

## Results Summary

| Test | Value | % of Mean | Reference Range | Mean ± SD | Status |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Total Buccal Protein yield | 703 | - | - | - | - |
| Citrate Synthase (CS)§ | 29.24 | 242% | 4.4 – 22 | 12.1 ± 5.1 | **High** |
| RC-IV (RC-IV/CS)¶ | 0.140 | 45% | 0.15 – 0.6 | 0.31 ± 0.1 | **Low** |
| RC-I (RC-I/CS)¶ | 3.6 | 54% | 3.4 – 11.9 | 6.8 ± 2.0 | Normal |
| RC-II (activity/CS)¶ | 0.121 | 63% | 0.03 – 0.35 | 0.194 ± 0.08 | Normal |
| RC-II+III (activity/CS)¶ | 0.018 | 19% | 0.032 – 0.152 | 0.092 ± 0.03 | **Low** |

**Units:**
- §: Activity value as nanomoles/min/mg buccal protein
- ¶: Presented as ratio of the corresponding RC activity to CS activity

## Abnormal Results

### High Values

| Test | Value | % of Mean | Finding |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Citrate Synthase | 29.24 | 242% | Significantly above normal range - indicates elevated mitochondrial content |

### Low Values

| Test | Value | % of Mean | Finding |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| RC-IV (Complex IV) | 0.140 | 45% | Below normal range - marginally decreased activity |
| RC-II+III | 0.018 | 19% | Below normal range |

## Interpretation

1. **Elevated Citrate Synthase (242%)**: The overall content of mitochondria was significantly above the normal range. This ~2.5-fold higher CS activity may suggest a compensatory function in response to mitochondrial dysfunction.

2. **Decreased RC-IV (45%)**: Activity of Respiratory Chain Complex-IV was below the normal range. However, the RC-IV deficiency found was statistically non-significant.

3. **Normal RC-I (54%)**: Activity of Respiratory Chain Complex-I was in the normal range (though on the lower end).

4. **Normal RC-II (63%)**: Activity was in the normal range.

5. **Decreased RC-II+III (19%)**: Activity was below the normal range.

## Clinical Significance

- Biochemical analysis suggests marginally decreased activity of RC-IV and normal range activity of RC-I, but CS activity was increased significantly above normal
- The elevated CS activity may represent a compensatory response to mitochondrial dysfunction from decreased RC-IV activities
- The RC-IV deficiency was statistically non-significant

## Recommendations

- **Periodic monitoring of mitochondrial enzyme assessment is strongly suggested**
- Recommended to repeat buccal testing within six months to see if the deficiency is repeatable

## Important Notes

1. Buccal mitochondrial enzyme testing is still a work in continued development
2. Published data supports buccal tissue representation of skeletal muscle RC enzyme activities in 84% of cases studied
3. Strong correlation has been experienced between buccal cell mitochondrial analysis and brain/neurological system problems
4. The proportion of defective to normal mitochondria varies broadly and determines disease presence and severity
5. Accurate assessment may require more than one independent testing

## Disclaimers

- This MITOswab test is a lab developed test (LDT) and not yet approved by FDA
- The RC-I, RC-II, and RC-II+III activity assay validations are not complete; results should be considered for research purposes only

## Abnormal Findings

### 3-Oxoglutaric - Elevated (Yeast/Fungal Marker)
- **Value**: 1.0 mmol/mol creatinine (Reference: <= 0.46)
- **Status**: High (>2x upper limit)
- **Clinical Significance**: Indicates yeast/fungal overgrowth in the GI tract
- **Recommendations**: Antifungal treatment; probiotic supplementation

### Tartaric Acid - Severely Elevated (Aspergillus Marker)
- **Value**: 131 mmol/mol creatinine (Reference: <= 6.5)
- **Status**: Very High (>20x upper limit)
- **Clinical Significance**: Strong indicator of yeast/fungal overgrowth, specifically Aspergillus species. This is the highest elevation among all markers.
- **Recommendations**: Aggressive antifungal protocol required; prescription antifungals may be necessary

### Arabinose - Elevated (Yeast Marker)
- **Value**: 82 mmol/mol creatinine (Reference: <= 50)
- **Status**: High (~1.6x upper limit)
- **Clinical Significance**: Indicates general yeast overgrowth in the GI tract
- **Recommendations**: Antifungal therapy and probiotic supplementation

### 2-Hydroxyphenylacetic Acid - Elevated (Bacterial Marker)
- **Value**: 1.3 mmol/mol creatinine (Reference: <= 0.86)
- **Status**: High (~1.5x upper limit)
- **Clinical Significance**: Indicates bacterial overgrowth
- **Recommendations**: Antibacterial agents; probiotics

### 4-Hydroxyhippuric - Elevated (Bacterial Marker)
- **Value**: 31 mmol/mol creatinine (Reference: <= 30)
- **Status**: Slightly High
- **Clinical Significance**: Bacterial marker, slightly elevated
- **Recommendations**: Monitor; may improve with general gut restoration

## Summary & Recommendations

This January 2022 Microbial Organic Acids Test reveals **severe yeast/fungal overgrowth**:

### Key Findings:

1. **Severe Yeast/Fungal Overgrowth**:
   - Tartaric acid at 131 (ref <= 6.5) - **20x upper limit** - indicates severe Aspergillus overgrowth
   - Arabinose at 82 (ref <= 50) - indicates general yeast overgrowth
   - 3-Oxoglutaric at 1.0 (ref <= 0.46) - additional fungal marker

2. **Bacterial Overgrowth**:
   - 2-Hydroxyphenylacetic elevated at 1.3 (ref <= 0.86)
   - 4-Hydroxyhippuric slightly elevated at 31 (ref <= 30)

3. **Positive Findings**:
   - Clostridia markers all normal (HPHPA at 148 is within range)
   - 4-Cresol normal (no C. difficile concern)
   - DHPPA (beneficial bacteria marker) present

### Comparison with Later Tests:
This test from January 2022 shows more severe fungal overgrowth than the March 2023 OAT test, suggesting the condition was more acute at this earlier time point.

| Marker | Jan 2022 | Mar 2023 | Trend |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Tartaric | 131 | 21 | Improved (but still high) |
| Arabinose | 82 | 71 | Improved (but still high) |
| HPHPA | 148 | 471 | Worsened (Clostridia) |

### Treatment Recommendations:

1. **Aggressive Antifungal Protocol** (Priority):
   - Prescription antifungals recommended given severity (e.g., Nystatin, Fluconazole)
   - Or intensive botanical protocol (oregano oil, caprylic acid, berberine)
   - Duration: Several months may be required

2. **Probiotic Support**:
   - High-potency multi-strain probiotics (50+ billion CFUs)
   - Saccharomyces boulardii specifically helpful for yeast control

3. **Dietary Modifications**:
   - Reduce sugar and refined carbohydrates
   - Limit yeast-containing foods
   - Anti-candida diet considerations

4. **Address Bacterial Overgrowth**:
   - Natural antibacterials alongside antifungal treatment
   - Lactobacillus rhamnosus supplementation

5. **Follow-up Testing**:
   - Retest MOAT in 3-4 months to assess treatment efficacy
